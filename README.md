Hi, I am *𝗙𝘂𝗹𝗹 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝗗𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗿* and *𝗠𝗼𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗲 𝗔𝗽𝗽 𝗗𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗿* with 𝟭𝟬+ 𝘆𝗲𝗮𝗿𝘀 of experience, specializing in backend development using PHP.

Professional in Symfony and Laravel frameworks with PostgreSQL or MySQL databases. My experience also includes working with WordPress, Yii2, XenForo, and Oracle DB.
However, I can quickly adapt to virtually any PHP-based framework or CMS.

Beyond backend development, I have strong frontend skills and proficiency in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Vue.js, jQuery, and Bootstrap.

I'm not afraid of unfamiliar technologies. My experience allows me to quickly learn new technologies.
