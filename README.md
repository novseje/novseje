# 👋 Hi!

Beyond backend development, I have strong frontend skills and proficiency in **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **React**, **Vue.js**, **jQuery**, and **Bootstrap**.

Additionally, I have a solid understanding of server administration, including configuring *Nginx*, *Apache*, mail servers, *Redis*, *Memcached*, and more.
